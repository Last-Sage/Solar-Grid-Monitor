# Solar-Grid-Monitor
This project monitors the energy meter readings of a grid-connected solar power plant and displays the data wirelessly in real-time using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system reads pulses from KSEB and solar meters, calculates energy consumption, and serves a web page with real-time data updates over Wi-Fi.
